In this project, 

the variables were created by declaring them above the function that takes in the users keyboard activity as an event.

There are counters to read the number of losses, wins, and letters guessed and is displayed back to the screen using an .innerHTML tag.

The data values for each variable are updated after receiving new information.

The number is generated randomly when the player either loses or wins the round and is set to play again to their hearts content.
